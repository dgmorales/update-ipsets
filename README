Loads iptables ipsets[1] definition and members from files.

WHAT

Say you have:

~$ cat /etc/ipsets/set.list 
canssh hash:ip  # hosts that can ssh to me
webports bitmap:port range 0-12000 # http(s) alternate ports

~$ cat /etc/ipsets/canssh 
10.1.1.3 	# some host
10.4.5.6	# another host

~$ cat /etc/ipsets/webports 
80
443
8003 # some http svc

Running update-ipsets will make those sets for you.

It will add or remove sepecific set elements as needed to make the set exactly
the way you describe in the file, without flushing the whole set and then
loading all members back.

WHY

Or why just not ipset save > /etc/somefile and the load it back on boot?

Because I want to have the comments, and its also nice to have the sets
members separated on one file per set.
